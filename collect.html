		<p>Jane needs to go live with a form to <strong>collect</strong> information from her users. She asks for the form but John from IT tells her that it will take a couple of months before there is time for that in the backlog. She needs the data before that for a report and can't wait, so she investigates whether there are tools available. She finds a couple of options and suggest them to John - even though it would require a round of procurement. John checks the tools and quickly gets back that they won't be secure enough and get's back with some alternatives. These alternatives don't seem to allow Jane to stay on brand. However, she is desperate and accepts one of the tools. BUT... During contracting legal discovers that the tool isn't compliant and cannot be used.<br /><br />Jane, eventually, ask for a delay to deliver the report and accepts to wait for the development team. Four months later she has the form live.</p>

		<h2 class="lightgreen">What are we doing?</h2>
		<p>Well, the topic is around digital experiences and our ideas circle around the philosophy to ease the work for content editors. However, we can be more specific.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We want to offer a better way to build and collect forms to gather data from Data Subjects in a global context. We want to do this with high focus on compliance and ensure that all stakeholders (editors, developers, compliance and end-users) enjoy our platform!</li>
			<li>We want to offer Content Editors a simpler way to adjust the look and feel of their components across breakpoints in a simple, intuitiv and visual way. This will increase flexiblity, lower time to market and reduce development cost of trivial variants of visual representation!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our aim is to become a certified member of <a href="https://machalliance.org/" title="The MACH Alliance">The MACH Alliance</a> (<b>M</b>icroservice, <b>A</b>PI-first, <b>C</b>loud-native, <b>H</b>eadless) and integrate in the eco-system as well as participate in the customer care program.</p>
